I want to start gardening, but I knew I wouldnâ€™t keep up the regular schedule of watering the plants and making sure that they remain healthy. So, I recruited a micro-controllers and suite of sensors to help with this tasks.Watering is the most important cultural practice and most labour intensive task in daily gardening operation. Watering systems ease the burden of getting water to plants when they need it. Knowing when and how much to water is two important aspects of watering process. To make the gardener works easy, the automatic plant watering system is created. Smart Garden is a plant environmental monitoring system. It monitors the soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity of your plant(s) and automatically waters the plant based on the data received by sensors. Other than that functionalties like Artificial Sunlight and Camera to keep view on plants can also be added. Thingspeak and Blynk application is used to view those  sensor data from remote location. With the help of blynk app, notification service can also be added.
